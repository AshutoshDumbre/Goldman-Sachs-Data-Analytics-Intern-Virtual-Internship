Task 1-Basic Excel Skills
Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet tool in the banking and finance industry today. Regardless of whether you pursue a career in accounting, corporate finance, commercial banking or investment banking, you can expect to use Microsoft Excel on a regular basis.
To maximize your chances of career success, mastering Excel as early as possible is key. As a new graduate at the firm, your first task is to run through a series of worked examples, designed to teach the fundamentals of Excel, as they apply to banking and finance applications.
Broadly, these worked examples cover:
Cell Basics (alignment, cell manipulation, column and row manipulation, text formats, cell formats, dates, basic formulas, copying, pasting and transposing)
Formatting (numbers, borders, column/row alignment, text to column)
Comments (adding, removing)
Naming (name manager, use in formulas)
Setting up a new sheet (header, font selection and font size, column and row sizing)

Task 2: Forecasting Operating Assumptions
Your firm has been asked to assist its client, a cupcake shop that produces baked goods for both consumers and businesses, with forecasting its business plan. They are keen to understand what their business will look like in five years’ time if all goes to plan. 
Your task is to create a set of assumptions within the Excel template provided, based on the information from the client contained within the file. The operating assumptions are split out between Revenue, Costs, Cash Flow and Other.
Your task is to complete the provided Excel template to build out forecast assumptions, which hones the skills you learned in Module 1. You have also been provided with a glossary of key terms within the Excel file.

Task 3: Translating Assumptions to the P&L
Armed with a completed set of forecast assumptions, we now turn our attention to producing a forecast profit and loss (P&L) statement. This financial statement shows a company’s profit or loss over a particular period (typically a financial year). 
The profit or loss is calculated by taking total revenue and subtracting expenses that stem from both operating and non-operating activities. It lays out revenue, direct costs, gross profit, operating expenses, depreciation, amortization, net interest, taxes and net profit in a logical manner.
Your task is to use the P&L Excel template provided to complete the task. 
You will notice that the P&L’s structure typically follows that of the assumptions sheet in terms of order, with a number of performance metrics included between the P&L line items (e.g. revenue growth, margin percentages). The included glossary should also prove useful to navigate any unfamiliar terms. 

Task  4: Forecasting Cash Flows
To ensure that the cupcake shop has enough cash to execute its 5-year plan, we need to forecast the cupcake shop’s future cash flows. This will involve calculating the net cash flow for each year for the business, taking into account key operating, investing and financing cash flows. 
It is noteworthy that the client has indicated that any excess net cash flow is to be used to pay down debt (as opposed to adding to the cash balance).
Your senior has provided you with a simplified template for forecasting future cash flows. 
Your task is to:
Utilize the cash flow assumptions alongside the previously completed P&L tab to complete the Cash Flow tab. This will ultimately show whether the cupcake shop will have enough cash during the forecast period to continue to pay down its debt and maintain a positive cash balance. 
Then link up the Net Interest line in the P&L with the calculated figures within the Cash Flow tab. 

Task 5: Creating Outputs in Excel
You’ve now arrived at the final task in conducting a forecast Excel analysis for the cupcake shop! Now that you’ve built out a forecast set of assumptions and financial metrics, it is time to summarize this data into charts that are ready for the client’s review.
Your senior has asked that you create the following charts within Excel in line with the client’s formatting standards:
Column Chart showing Revenue from 2020-24
Line Chart showing Closing Debt from 2020-24
Area Chart showing Closing Cash from 2020-24
Combination Chart with Columns showing Cupcake Units Sold from 2020-24 and a Line showing Average Sale Price from 2020-24

An example chart has been included which is in line with the client’s formatting standards. It is critical to pay particular attention to font size, font color, chart colors, text labels, text number formats and line formatting. Note for the area chart, the only data point text label required is for the final year (2024). For the combination chart, ensure to include a legend and axis labels for both the primary vertical axis and secondary vertical axis. A tutorial on some of the major features of Excel charting has also been included.
